# SEER Sensor – Docs Directory

This folder is reserved for **documentation, guides, and reference material** for the SEER Sensor project.  
It provides the “manuals” that explain how SEER works, how to set it up, and how to use it.

---

## Planned Contents

- **ARCHITECTURE.md**  
  High-level design of SEER (ingest → normalize → UDP output).  
  Includes diagrams of data flow and component interactions.

- **NETWORKING.md**  
  Notes on connecting SEER to SPAN/TAP ports, supported interfaces, and filtering options.

- **ENDPOINTS.md**  
  Guidance for host telemetry ingestion.  
  Explains supported sources (Sysmon, osquery, custom JSON) and how they map into the schema.

- **SCHEMA.md**  
  Reference for the unified JSON event format.  
  Lists field names, types, and which sources provide them.

- **HARDWARE.md**  
  Benchmark results for SEER running on different platforms (NUC, SBC, mini-PC).  
  Includes minimum viable hardware specs.

- **TESTING.md**  
  Instructions for validating a sensor with sample data.  
  Explains how to replay PCAPs, ingest host logs, and check outputs.

## Purpose

- Serve as the **knowledge base** for developers, operators, and contributors.  
- Keep all diagrams, field references, and how-to guides in one place.  
- Provide context for decisions made in configs and code.

⚠️ **Note:** These documents will evolve alongside development milestones.  
At early stages, they will mostly contain **plans and placeholders**.
