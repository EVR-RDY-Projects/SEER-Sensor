# Hardware Notes (POC)

This folder is a **scratchpad** for early hardware testing and exploration.  
Use it to capture quick findings, ideas, and lessons learned during setup.

## Examples
- Which BIOS settings needed to be changed
- Which NICs worked or failed
- Power/thermal quirks
- Driver issues
