# SEER Sensor – Hardware (POC)

This directory documents all **hardware exploration for the Proof of Concept (POC)** phase.  
The focus is on identifying **low-cost, workable platforms** that can run the SEER software stack (ingest → normalize → UDP JSON output).

## Subfolders

- **bom/** → Draft Bills of Materials (parts lists + rough costs).
- **notes/** → Scratchpad for setup steps and performance benchmarks.
- **diagrams/** → Placeholder for wiring diagrams, photos, or quick sketches.

⚠️ Everything here is **experimental**. Nothing is final or production-ready.
